# Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled `vqls.ipynb`, which demonstrates the implementation of the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS). This algorithm leverages quantum computing and variational techniques to solve linear systems of equations.

## Overview

The Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to solve linear systems of equations of the form \(Ax = b\). It utilizes a parameterized quantum circuit to approximate the solution vector \(x\), optimized using classical methods. This notebook serves as an introduction to VQLS, providing step-by-step instructions and visualizations of the algorithm's process.

## Features

- **Introduction to VQLS**: Explains the theoretical foundations and implementation of the VQLS algorithm.
- **Parameterized Quantum Circuit**: Demonstrates the construction of a quantum circuit for encoding the solution vector.
- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimization**: Combines quantum state preparation with classical optimizers to minimize the cost function.
- **Visualization**: Includes plots and figures to illustrate the optimization process and results.
